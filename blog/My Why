A big part of my why is these two. My girls.

I want to show them what a woman stepping up into her power looks like.

I want to be financially free so that I can be there for them when they need me.

I want my girls to know that they can achieve whatever they set their minds to. That they don't have to stay stuck in a job they dislike just to pay the bills.

That they don't have to let their fears hold them back.

That they can shine bright and follow their dreams.

That they can be the change they want in the world.

I found this business when I was looking for something that aligned with my core values of creativity, education, conscious living, community & personal growth.

I'm 18 months into this journey and every day I wake up excited about what lays ahead. The job satisfaction I receive when I hear from my team/customers about how our products have changed their families' health & wellbeing fills my heart.

I'm so excited about this journey and if you want to come along for the ride with me, please get in touch. There's room for each of us to grow and the journey is only just beginning ‚ù§

This photo is from this morning. They climbed up onto our bed for wake up cuddles with me and then we opened the curtains to let the day shine in on us all. A simple yet beautiful moment. I could have used a staged shot but I love the morning light, their fuzzy slept-in hair & PJ‚Äôs. üëåüèª

One of my childhood memories is visiting my grandparents place & watching my Grandad tend to his roses. ðŸŒ¹ They were such prickly, ugly plants but the flowers they produced were divine. Grandad was fiercely protective of his Rose plants & us kids learnt to respect them because of him & because of the sharp thorns!

I have a deeper appreciation for this divine flower now that I own some precious Rose oil. For such a beautiful big flower, it has a very low yield of essential oil. It takes approximately 242 000 petals (or 8000 Rose flowers) to produce 5mL of Rose oil. This low yield means that Rose oil is VERY precious. I treasure my Rose Touch roller bottle. I like to wear it over my heart to uplift & soften my mood - and feel more like a goddess. I also like to smell it & remember my grandparents who are no longer with us ðŸ’•

If youâ€™d like to purchase this precious oil, get in touch & Iâ€™ll help you out. I think it would make the perfect gift for your Mother for Motherâ€™s Day!

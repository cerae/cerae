I can’t believe that I’m posting this. For my whole life, I’ve been so self-conscious about my legs - especially my THIGHS. I’ve always worn long shorts in summer & never bared my legs above the knee unless I’m wearing tights/stockings. I’ve wasted years of my life with low self-worth and poor body-image. I’ve missed out on experiences and hidden myself away in (what now seems ridiculous) fear of rejection or ridicule. 

But this Summer something shifted. I stopped caring that I don’t have flawless, perfectly toned legs. I don’t have a thigh gap (& never will). I have some spider veins, cellulite and my skin is WHITE. I have Type 1 skin that always burns and NEVER tans (not one bit unless you count freckles as tanning lol). 

The thing is, I’ve come to terms with my “imperfection”. It only took me nearly 37 years but I’m happy to say that I’ve finally got here. And you know what? It’s bloody liberating!! 

So how did I get here? 

Motherhood: Having kids forces you to grow up & realise that you’re not the centre of the universe. It forces you to see what’s important and what’s not. It makes you realise that what you say, how you act and what you do is taken in by your children. I want to set a good example to my daughters. I don’t want them to grow up with body image issues from me. So, I’ve learnt to be comfortable in my own skin. 

Self-worth: Working at running my own business has meant I’ve had to face a LOT of challenges especially regarding my own self-worth. I’ve had to learn (and keep learning) to believe in myself. This means not caring so much what others think (or say). Letting go of what others think means that I don’t care what they think of my thighs. Hell, they probably don’t even look at them anyway!!! 

Essential Oils: I regularly use Bergamot in my diffuser or purefumes. Bergamot is the oil of self-acceptance. It can help relieve feelings of self-judgement and low self-esteem and awakens us to self-confidence and true self-acceptance. I also use a whole range of doTERRA oils, products and supplements on a daily basis – all of which work together to mean that I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been. When you’re healthy, you feel good and when you feel good, everything is awesome! 

So here I am, wearing my short shorts that I got from Sparrow & Co at the markets last month. Aren’t they cute? They’re made from bits and pieces of vintage fabric and there’s even a doily on the back pocket (I tried but couldn’t master the art of getting a photo of my bum!).

I say embrace your imperfections and be confident in yourself! We’re all unique and beautiful in our own ways. Oh and if in doubt, use an essential oil!

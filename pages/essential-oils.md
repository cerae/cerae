# My Story
When my second daughter was 4 months old, she went through what is commonly referred to as ‘sleep regression’. She went from waking every 3-4 hours at night to waking every 20-30 minutes. She went from being an easy baby to being very hard work. 

I couldn’t simply sleep when she slept during the day because I had my 3-year-old daughter at home with me and very limited family support. I went from rocking it to not coping. 

At my mother’s group one week, I saw some of a presentation about essential oils and how they can be used as natural medicine. I barely saw the talk because my overtired and distraught baby was crying so much (and other daughter was in full Threenager mode) BUT my curiosity was piqued & I knew in my gut that this was something BIG so I made sure to speak to the ladies at the end. They lent me a diffuser and gave me three small samples of some oils to help me and my baby with our sleep and coping issues. I went home filled with hope. 
 
That night I diffused Lavender Peace blend and baby A slept a little better. The next day I used Balance blend and diffused Citrus Bliss blend and felt a little better. 
Then I started feeling good and then great! 

The overwhelm shifted completely and I was rocking it again. Before the little sample vials were used up I had contacted the woman who’d given them to me and had signed up to have my own Wholesale Account. I bought a Home Essentials Kit and set up my loyalty rewards program (LRP) order to get some more of the emotional blends the following month. 

I was hooked. 
These oils work. 
I knew that I wanted to share them with everyone so we can benefit from these gifts of the earth.
 
# Why doTERRA? 

My core passion has always been to do with protecting and improving our environment and our world. Can you imagine how excited I was when I found doTERRA and learnt that they are ethical and source their oils sustainably? Yes!! 

I have always been interested in and have used natural therapies for my and my family’s health concerns. doTERRA essential oils are the purest on the planet and so much care has been taken to ensure they contain absolutely no contaminants or synthetic fillers. They are 100% pure. In fact, our oils are so pure that you can go to www.sourcetoyou.com and type in the batch number (from the base of one of our bottles) and receive a full report of everything that is in that bottle. 

It’s so comforting to know that I have a natural first aid kit to deal with all sorts of ailments. I don’t advocate avoiding conventional medicine all together by any means. But I am empowered to be able to try and treat ailments at home. Often they are cured naturally and we don’t require any further treatment or medicines (and their not so nice side effects). 

# Co Impact Sourcing
The oils are ethically sourced from all over the world where the plants are native to using the best farming, collection, harvesting and distilling processes.

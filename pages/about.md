Hello, I’m Cerae. I’m Mum to two young girls (ages 2 & 4) who make me laugh, cry, dance, sing, cook, clean, create, caffeinate, plan, play and love like never before. They rock my world but don’t define me completely; I also love to conduct workshops, run my own business, practice yoga, geek out on essential oils & all their uses, read books, write, grow plants, connect with friends, create things, travel, learn and grow.
 
But let’s rewind a couple of decades: I grew up in a Co Operative in regional South-East Queensland. I had an idyllic childhood of playing in the bush with my siblings and the other kids on the Co Op in the days before home computers, the Internet and mobile phones. We had Solar power and had to use a generator when we were allowed to watch a movie (usually Labyrinth or a David Attenborough Documentary). My parents built our house from scratch and were both self-employed. Dad was a sculptor and builder while Mum was a Homoeopath (and is now a midwife too). Because of my slightly unusual upbringing, I struggled to find my tribe in high school so after graduating, I did what made me happy and studied Visual Arts at Uni where I met my future husband.

I then followed the “safe and normal” path of becoming a high school teacher. It consumed me until I burnt out 5 years later and we escaped the rat race by literally sailing off into the sunset in our yacht (and first home), Anima. Our journey from Brisbane to Thailand took just under 3 years and was an incredible learning experience for both of us. To read more about our sailing adventure read my travel blog over at http://sailbirds.blogspot.com.au
 
I faced many fears and grew in many different ways during those years of travelling on the sea. Owning a boat isn’t all sunsets and sundowners and while doing seemingly endless maintenance on Anima at a boatyard in Malaysia, my ovaries suddenly woke up and started campaigning me to have children. They won in the end and we sold our floating home to fly back to Australia and start a land-based life again (for now).
 
Throughout our sailing adventure, my hubby and I kept brainstorming ideas for what careers we could pursue rather than the ones we’d fallen into after high school. It was only after having my second child that I finally discovered the job I’d been searching for. I found an ethical company that empowers its members to follow their dreams, push through their blocks and bloom. I get to work from home – or wherever I want to, at my own pace and schedule. I get to help people by empowering them to take control of their own health and wellness by using natural solutions to common ailments and low tox living. I get to hold workshops and gatherings where we talk about all the things and make our own household cleaning and personal care products or perfumes and emotion “potions”. I get to be part of and lead my own team of lovely souls. Above all, I get to make a positive difference to people and I get to step more lightly upon this earth by living more consciously and helping others to do so too.
 
Well, there you go. Thank you for reading this far. If you would like to find out more about my business or start your own, please get in touch anytime. If you'd like to buy some essential oils, head on over to my essential oils page or get in touch anytime. xx

Here's a collection of the recipes I've used/created for a variety of home cleaning, eating and personal care. 
Before we go into the recipes, it’s important that you use a GLASS spray bottle (for any of the sprays) when using pure essential oils. If you use plastic, the essential oils will draw chemicals out of the plastic into your spray – yuck! 

## Household Cleaning 
- DIY Wet Wipes
What you’ll need:
An empty container with a good lid. I recommend a 1Litre Feta / Yoghurt bucket or similar size Ice Cream container. 
Good quality paper hand towel (eg. Who Gives A Crap or Viva).
2.5 cups Filtered water
Very sharp knife
2.5 Tablespoons Fractionated Coconut Oil 
2-3 drops each of Lavender, Tea Tree & Geranium essential oil.
How to make it:
It’s so easy you’ll wonder why you didn’t do this earlier! 
Into your container, measure out water, fractionated coconut oil and essential oils. Give it a swirl or a stir to combine. 
With a sharp knife, cut the paper towel in half down the middle so that you end up with two toilet paper sized rolls of towel.
Carefully insert your cut paper towel half into your container and then remove the cardboard inner tube. 
Allow to sit for 10 or so minutes and then it’s good to go! Pull the wipes out from the centre. They should last for at least few weeks as long as you keep the lid on when not in use. 

- Air Freshener ("Stinky Be Gone!")
This is so simple and far better than using a toxic odour spray. I used to not bother but since having kids (& getting married) there are lots more smells and sometimes those smells are so stinky!

Mostly fill a glass spray bottle with water. Add 2 Tablespoons of Witch Hazel. Then get creative with your oils of choice. Some nice ideas are: Citrus Bliss, Elevation, Peppermint + Wild Orange, Lemongrass + Purify, Tangerine + Lavender. 
Try 10 drops of Essential oil to start with. Add more if needed. 

- Surface Spray
I have two methods for this all-purpose spray. Both a super effective, cheap and safe to use around kids. 

1. In a glass spray bottle half fill it with filtered water and half with white vinegar. 
You might like to add a squirt of Castille Soap. 
Then add your essential oils of choice. A good combination to help protect against environmental threats is 10 drops each of OnGuard blend, Tea Tree and Lemon & 5 drops Oregano. 

2. Another simpler version is to buy the doTERRA OnGuard Cleaner Concentrate and simply add a Tablespoon to filtered water in a spray bottle. You can reuse your existing plastic spray bottle with this recipe. 

- Window Cleaner 
In a glass spray bottle fill it up 50/50 with filtered water and white vinegar. Add 10 drops of Lemon Essential oil. 

- Liquid Hand Soap
2 Tablespoons of Castile soap
1 Tablespoon Fractionated coconut oil (optional)
15-20 drops essential oil (I love OnGuard but have used Lemon + Tea Tree; Patchouli + Lime; Lavender + Geranium; Lemongrass... the options are endless!)
Top up with filtered water and you're done!
Just ensure to use foaming pumps - my Mum tried it with a normal pump and it didn't work.

## Self Care
- DIY Lip Balm

What you’ll need:
Empty lip balm tubes or bottles
Saucepan, bowl, Measuring cups, Spatula, Spoon, Funnel
¼ cup Beeswax
¼ cup Shea Butter
¼ cup Coconut Oil 
10 drops Peppermint Essential Oil
10 drops Lavender Essential Oil 
You could try other Essential Oil combinations such as Orange and Cinnamon, OnGuard & Lemon, Tangerine & Lime… the options are up to your imagination. You can also add some natural mineral makeup / Cocoa powder / Beetroot juice to tint your lip balm if you like!

How to make it:
Measure out the Beeswax, Shea Butter and Coconut oil into a stainless steel or Pyrex bowl. Place this bowl over a small saucepan of boiling water (being careful to not let any of the water into your bowl). Stir occasionally and then remove from heat once everything has melted together nicely. Add your essential oils and stir them through. Promptly pour the mixture into your empty lip balm bottles or tubes and then let them rest on your bench until they set before putting on the lids.

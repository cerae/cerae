Here's a collection of the recipes I've used/created for a variety of home cleaning, eating and personal care. 
Before we go into the recipes, it’s important that you use a GLASS spray bottle (for any of the sprays) when using pure essential oils. If you use plastic, the essential oils will draw chemicals out of the plastic into your spray – yuck! 

## Household Cleaning 
- DIY Wet Wipes
What you’ll need:
An empty container with a good lid. I recommend a 1Litre Feta / Yoghurt bucket or similar size Ice Cream container. 
Good quality paper hand towel (eg. Who Gives A Crap or Viva).
2.5 cups Filtered water
Very sharp knife
2.5 Tablespoons Fractionated Coconut Oil 
2-3 drops each of Lavender, Tea Tree & Geranium essential oil.
How to make it:
It’s so easy you’ll wonder why you didn’t do this earlier! 
Into your container, measure out water, fractionated coconut oil and essential oils. Give it a swirl or a stir to combine. 
With a sharp knife, cut the paper towel in half down the middle so that you end up with two toilet paper sized rolls of towel.
Carefully insert your cut paper towel half into your container and then remove the cardboard inner tube. 
Allow to sit for 10 or so minutes and then it’s good to go! Pull the wipes out from the centre. They should last for at least few weeks as long as you keep the lid on when not in use. 

- Air Freshener ("Stinky Be Gone!")
This is so simple and far better than using a toxic odour spray. I used to not bother but since having kids (& getting married) there are lots more smells and sometimes those smells are so stinky!

Mostly fill a glass spray bottle with water. Add 2 Tablespoons of Witch Hazel. Then get creative with your oils of choice. Some nice ideas are: Citrus Bliss, Elevation, Peppermint + Wild Orange, Lemongrass + Purify, Tangerine + Lavender. 
Try 10 drops of Essential oil to start with. Add more if needed. 

- Surface Spray
I have two methods for this all-purpose spray. Both a super effective, cheap and safe to use around kids. 

1. In a glass spray bottle half fill it with filtered water and half with white vinegar. 
You might like to add a squirt of Castille Soap. 
Then add your essential oils of choice. A good combination to help protect against environmental threats is 10 drops each of OnGuard blend, Tea Tree and Lemon & 5 drops Oregano. 

2. Another simpler version is to buy the doTERRA OnGuard Cleaner Concentrate and simply add a Tablespoon to filtered water in a spray bottle. You can reuse your existing plastic spray bottle with this recipe. 

- Window Cleaner 
In a glass spray bottle fill it up 50/50 with filtered water and white vinegar. Add 10 drops of Lemon Essential oil. 

- Liquid Hand Soap
2 Tablespoons of Castile soap
1 Tablespoon Fractionated coconut oil (optional)
15-20 drops essential oil (I love OnGuard but have used Lemon + Tea Tree; Patchouli + Lime; Lavender + Geranium; Lemongrass... the options are endless!)
Top up with filtered water and you're done!
Just ensure to use foaming pumps - my Mum tried it with a normal pump and it didn't work.

## Self Care
- DIY Lip Balm

What you’ll need:
Empty lip balm tubes or bottles
Saucepan, bowl, Measuring cups, Spatula, Spoon, Funnel
¼ cup Beeswax
¼ cup Shea Butter
¼ cup Coconut Oil 
10 drops Peppermint Essential Oil
10 drops Lavender Essential Oil 
You could try other Essential Oil combinations such as Orange and Cinnamon, OnGuard & Lemon, Tangerine & Lime… the options are up to your imagination. You can also add some natural mineral makeup / Cocoa powder / Beetroot juice to tint your lip balm if you like!

How to make it:
Measure out the Beeswax, Shea Butter and Coconut oil into a stainless steel or Pyrex bowl. Place this bowl over a small saucepan of boiling water (being careful to not let any of the water into your bowl). Stir occasionally and then remove from heat once everything has melted together nicely. Add your essential oils and stir them through. Promptly pour the mixture into your empty lip balm bottles or tubes and then let them rest on your bench until they set before putting on the lids. 

- Foot Sauce (heel balm)
This one is so easy and just so lovely and nourishing to use every night before sleep. I'm sticking with my accidental name of Foot Sauce. This oily life is so fun and makes me laugh all the time!

Makes about 200ml 
1/4 Cup Shea Butter
1/4 Cup Coconut Oil
3 Tablespoons Beeswax 
1/4 Cup extra oil (I don't recommend using Olive Oil as it's too overpowering. Rosehip, Hemp Seed or Jojoba are great). 
10 drops Essential Oil (I like 2-3 drops each of Myrrh, Vetiver, Whisper - the Blend for Women and Forgive - the Renewing Blend). Other ideas are Peppermint, Tea Tree, Lavender, Lemongrass and Sandalwood or any combination that takes your fancy! 

Melt everything but the oils together in a double boiler on the stove. 
Remove from heat and let cool slightly before adding the essential oils. 
Mix and pour directly into the tubs/jars you want to store your balm/sauce in. Due to the beeswax, this mixture starts to set quite quickly.

- Beard Balm
Makes about 100ml
4 teaspoons Beeswax 
2 or 3 teaspoons Shea Butter 
6 teaspoons Fractionated Coconut oil 
(1 teaspoon Vitamin E oil optional)
4 drops Cedar Wood 
4 drops Tea Tree
4 drops Frankincense 
4 drops Rosemary

Melt all ingredients bar the oils in a glass/stainless bowl over a saucepan of boiling water. Once melted, remove from heat and add oils. Pour into a jar or tin and allow to set (doesn't take very long!).

The Cedar Wood smells amazing. Very woody and earthy. I gave this to my Dad for his 65th birthday & he was a little unsure of what Beard Balm is or how to use it but I'm hoping he'll enjoy it!! It would make a very nourishing moisturiser too for dry/damaged skin.

- Natural Shaving Cream
Makes about 150ml
1/3 cup Shea Butter
1/3 cup Coconut Oil
1/4 cup Castille soap
2 teaspoons Baking Soda
5 drops Geranium Essential Oil (it's one of his favourites and is also great for your skin!)
5 drops Lavender 
5 drops Tea Tree

Melt the Shea Butter and Coconut oil in a double boiler (a bowl over a saucepan of boiling water). Once melted, add the Castile soap and Baking Soda then remove from the heat. Let it cool. Whip it until it's light and fluffy. Add the essential oils and whip again. Refrigerate until cool then whip one last time. Transfer to your container of choice. 

- Deodorant 
Makes about 130ml
2 Tablespoons Shea Butter
3 Tablespoons Coconut Oil
2 Tablespoons Arrowroot Powder
2 Tablespoons Bicarb
1 Tablespoon Cornflour 
6 drops Patchouli
8 drops Cedarwood
6 drops Bergamot
4 drops Ylang Ylang
4 drops Frankincense 
3 drops Lime 

Melt the Shea butter and Coconut oil together in either a double boiler or a glass jar sitting in a saucepan of boiling water (being careful to never let the water get into the mixture). 
Once melted, remove from heat and stir in the Arrowroot powder, Bicarb and Cornflour. Add your mix of essential oils and pour into a suitable container (glass or metal works best). Leave it on the counter or (refrigerate for 10+ minutes) to set before using.
